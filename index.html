<p>Since I eventually have to start documenting things, I figured this might be a good way to do it. So, here goes! </p>

The current "stable" data for this is located at <a href="tekdemo.github.com/project-sir-vo">tekdemo.github.com/project-sir-vo</a> , which will at some point be located at  <a href="project-sir-vo">it's project page</a>.</p>
