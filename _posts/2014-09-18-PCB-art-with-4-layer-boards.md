One of the fun things about designing 4 layer art boards is the extra dimension you get with the internal layers. With a bit of planning, you can really take advantage of the internal layers for some interesting effects.

One of the nicer things is with a white substrate (specifically, FR408 through <span title='my employer, if it matters for full disclosure'>OSH Park</span>), is that it's translucent enough that you can easily see through it, but it scatters effectively enough that the design on the reverse side is heavily obscured. With a bit of planning, you can get very excellent backlit designs.

The design of this particular project was driven by my friend Jason, who wanted something neat for the SOAK festival. I simply hopped in to help with the execution, since I have a bit more experience designing and viewing boards.
