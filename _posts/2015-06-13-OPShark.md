For Maker Faire 2015, us OSH Park folks decided to build a rather physical version of a terrible joke, starting from looking at anagrams of the company name. The final result of a 2 week team effort is the [OPShark]({{site.baseurl}}/opshark/): a fashionable and adorable animatronic plush shark that's harnessed the power of vehicular science, bent on world domination.
