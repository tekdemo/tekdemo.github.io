For Maker Faire 2014, us OSH Park folks wanted do design and build a hat for Laen. Needless to say, it got out of hand, and we wound up with an absurdly complex, fragine, and amazingly cool crown made entirely from PCB, luck, and a bit of magic. As a more complex project, it's got it's own build log and Git repo, viewable here: [PCB Crown]({{site.baseurl}}/pcb-crown/)
