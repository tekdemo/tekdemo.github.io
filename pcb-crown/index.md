The PCB Crown project was designed as an interesting gift for Laen. There's a bit of interesting history that went into development, alongside a whole lot of interesting lessons that came from trying to build large 3D circutry. 
To help sort out the documentation, I've broken it up into a few different sections. 

For a brief overview, check out the Readme from the source repository on Github.
