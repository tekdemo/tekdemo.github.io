Build Instructions
=====
You're mad! If you want to replicate this or a similar project, please reference the [Build Log](buildlog.html) and [Lessons in 3D Circuits](lessons.html) first, since they explain a great many things relating to assembling and debugging this. If you have questions, comments, or chit chat, feel free to shoot me an email!

I also don't have a lot of pictures for this step....
